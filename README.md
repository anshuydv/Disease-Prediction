# Disease-Prediction
This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict diseases from symptoms.
The project involved analysis of diseases on patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVM,Logistic Regression etc This is the jupyter notebook code and dataset I've used for my Kaggle kernel 'Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras'

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of prognosis in a patient. 

Machine Learning algorithms used:

Logistic Regression 
Naive Bayes 
K-Nearest Neighbours 
Decision Tree 
Random Forest 
XGBoost 
Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer (Keras)
Accuracy achieved: 100% (K-Nearest Neighbours)

This dataset has 133 total columns, 132 of them being symptoms experienced by patiend and last column in prognosis for the same.

This dataset has 3 columns:
Disease  | Count of Disease Occurrence | Symptom
